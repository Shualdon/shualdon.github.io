          description: The shape and size of a conjugated Pi-system have an integral role on a molecule's electronic properties. This toolkit provides various descriptors that can be used for machine learning applications, including the number of conjugated atoms, the length of the system as the area of the system.

    description: Combining machine learning and quantum mechanical features to find conjugated polymers with low reorganization energy
    contents:
        - title: Reorganization Energies
          description: Reorganization energy can be seen as an energy barrier for electron transfer that comes from the molecular conformational change that happen during the transfer. Organic semi-conductive conjugated polymers with low reorganization energies are more efficient and can be used in various potential application. Due to the vast chemical space, finding those polymers can be a time-consuming process, which is why machine learning can help accelerate the search.
        - title: Machine Learning to Accelerate Screening
          description: By calculating the reorganization energies of a relatively small set of conjugated polymers we built a machine learning model that accelerated the search 13x. I performed feature engineering and found that adding semi-empirical quantum features greatly increase the accuracy of the model.

    description: Accelerating the search for novel materials using genetic algorithms.
    contents:
        - title: High-Spin Polymers
          description: High-spin polymers are a class of novel materials that have two unpaired electrons, making them bi-radicals. Those polymers are built from alternating monomers with one acting as an electron donor and the other as an electron acceptor. Finding the right combination of monomers that creates a stable high-spin polymer can be a time-consuming process.
        - title: HOMO-LUMO Gap
          description: I have found that the HOMO-LUMO gap of the polymer can be used as a predictor for the stability of the high-spin state. Additionally, I have found that the semi-empirical quantum method GFN2 can be used as a surrogate for DFT and greatly accelerate the search for those polymers.
        - title: Genetic Algorithms
          description: Genetic algorithms is an optimization method that I used to find a combination of monomers that creates a small HOMO-LUMO gap in the polymer. The algorithms uses an iterative method of crossover and mutation to created a new set of polymers in each generation, calculates the HOMO-LUMO gap of each, and only keep half of the population with the lowest gap. With each generation the algorithm finds polymers with lower and lower gap, until it reaches the termination condition.
        - title: Results
          description: I have found 1400 potential polymers that have a stable high-spin electronic state. By using the genetic algorithm I decreased the time it takes to find those polymers from a few weeks to just one day.
